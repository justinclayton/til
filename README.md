## Today I Learned

A simple single page app I used to learn GraphQL and AWS AppSync, a serverless GraphQL service. It uses CloudFormation to build the infrastructure, which includes S3, DynamoDB, and AppSync resources.

## Acknowledgements

Portions of this app are based on a hackathon project that included myself, @digivava, and @jhulten. Also, as I'm not very adept at styling, @aaronmclayton was enlisted to assist with the CSS. Thanks to them.
